## **Description and Instruction**

### Description:
Real-Time Video Display with Greetings and Date/Time Overlay

This Python code uses the Pygame library to create a real-time video display window with various elements. The program loads a video file, rotates it 90 degrees counterclockwise, and centers it on the window. It also displays a custom greeting message in the center of the window.

In addition, the code overlays the current date and time in the top-right corner of the window. The date is displayed in the "dd-mm-yyyy" format, and the time is displayed in the 12-hour format with AM/PM indication.

The window has a curved border drawn with a transparent surface, giving it an elegant look. The code also plays an audio file after a 1-second delay.

This code can be used as a simple welcome screen or as a starting point for more advanced multimedia applications. It demonstrates the usage of Pygame, video processing with OpenCV, text rendering, and audio playback.

Dependencies: Pygame, OpenCV (cv2)

Usage:
1. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   - pygame:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
   - opencv-python:

   ```
   
2. Modify the file paths in the code to specify your custom video, font, and audio files.

3. Run the script and enjoy the real-time video display with greetings and date/time overlay.

Note: Make sure to have the necessary video, font, and audio files in the specified paths for the program to work correctly.
